This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}

hma_subapps <- read_csv("HmaSubapplications.csv")

hma_subapps %>% filter(
  subapplicantState == "Michigan" & status == "subAwardAccepted"
  ) %>% 
  group_by(benefitingCounties) %>% 
  summarize(count = n()) %>% 
  arrange(desc(count))




hma_projects <- read_csv("HazardMitigationAssistanceProjects.csv")

hma_projects %>% 
  filter(state == "Michigan") %>% 
  group_by(programFy) %>% 
  summarize(federal_funding = sum(federalShareObligated))

hma_projects %>% 
  filter(state == "Michigan") %>% 
  filter(programFy == 2020:2023) %>% 
  group_by(county) %>% 
  summarize(count=n()) %>% 
  arrange(desc(count))

```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
